# Car-detection-using-openCV
For this project I have taken a sample video and used openCV to analyze the cars movement .<br />
The cars are framed in a box to show the movement of the object and has a high accuracy.<br />
The ipynb file as well as raw code is included.<br />
The sample video is attached too.<br />
